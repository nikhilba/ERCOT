# ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas)
## Introduction
This repository contains the process and results of a data science project to predict the increases or decreases in electricity generation at fossil power plants in Texas. It begins with data collection and processing, and shows how the data are combined. The data fall into two general groups: 1) average operating characteristics of power plants over the course of a year, and 2) the state of the ERCOT grid at a given point in time ($t$) and the hour directly preceding $t$. We use the first set of data to group power plants into clusters, and the second set of data to predict the behavior of each cluster.
